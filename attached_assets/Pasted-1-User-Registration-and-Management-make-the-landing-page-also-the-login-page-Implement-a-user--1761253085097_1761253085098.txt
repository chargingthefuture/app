1. User Registration and Management
make the landing page also the login page
   - Implement a user authentication system with functionalities for registration, login, and password recovery.
   - Securely store essential user information, including demographics and subscription status.
   - This app is invite only. Therefore there should be a mechanism to issue out invite codes to enable someone to register. This way only human trafficking victims are on the platform.
Invite Code System:
Admin-generated invite codes with custom parameters
Configurable max uses (1, 5, 10, 25, 100)
Optional expiration dates
Usage tracking and analytics
Auto-consumption on registration

2. Payment Processing:
   - Integrate a payment system to support a subscription model ($1/month).
   - Link payment details with user profiles for managing active subscriptions.
   - The subscription model needs to be dynamic. If someone subscribes for $1/month today. They are grandfathered in. In the future however, the price may increase to $2/month. And that will apply only to the new users and they are grandfathered into that subscription.

3. Product Database Design:
   - Create a Products table to store information about various services.
   Include the following fields:
     - Product ID
     - Product Name
     - Product Description
     - Product Type (e.g., transportation, accommodation)
     - Common Pricing Field
     - A JSON field for type-specific attributes.
     The current list of products are:
        - Incident Report: canceled or disrupted service
        - Incident Report: lost mail
        - Uber
        - Airbnb

   - Ensure that admin actions are secure and logged for accountability.

5. Scalable Architecture:
   - Design the application using modular components to facilitate the addition of new products in the future.
   - Ensure that each new app or service can communicate with the main user and product database through API calls.

6. Data Security and Privacy:
   - Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive user information and transaction details.
   - Utilize encrypted storage for sensitive data and ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations.
